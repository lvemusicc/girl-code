      </header> 1.Arboreal Lifestyle: These frogs are arboreal, meaning they spend most of their lives in trees. They are often found near streams and rivers, where they come down to mate. 

2.Sticky Toes: Glass frogs have sticky toe pads that help them climb and grip various surfaces, making them adept at navigating their arboreal habitats. 

3.Nocturnal Behavior: They are primarily nocturnal, hiding during the day and becoming active at night to hunt for small invertebrates like flies and spiders.

      <p>Glass frogs are called glass frogs because of their translucent skin, which allows their internal organs, including the heart, to be visible. This feature aids in their camouflage, making them difficult to spot by predators when they sleep on leaves. The name reflects their appearance, which is primarily lime green on the outside and transparent underneath, giving them a unique look that helps them blend into their surroundings. <footer class="post-meta"> Posted by <a href="#">zoey dupree</a></footer>

          <h1>What kind of habitat do they need to survive </h1></header>
        <p>Frogs are remarkably adaptable animals that can be found in a variety of habitats, ranging from temperate forests to arid deserts. While many people associate frogs primarily with wet environments, various species have evolved to survive in extreme conditions. For example, the Australian water-holding frog can withstand prolonged droughts by entering a state of dormancy and absorbing water in its body, allowing it to survive until conditions improve. This adaptability underscores the resilience of frogs and their ability to exploit a wide range of ecological niches. <a href="#">Read More</a>&raquo;</p>

          <h1>Behavior </h1>
        </header>
        <p>Glass frogs are usually active at night. This, combined with their transparent bodies, makes them very difficult to spot for people or for predators. A flashlight shown on a glass frog at night reveals little of the frog except its large eyes and a dark smudge where the skull is. During the daylight, the frogs hide among the leaves. Since the rainforest and cloud forests are so full of plants and trees, the tiny green frogs can easily stay out of sight if they sit on a leaf and do not move. The frogs also become even more invisible because they squat their bodies down flat on the leaves. Even from the side, they look much like a slight lump on the leaf rather than a living frog. Only the most careful observers see the frog during the day or at night. <a href="#">Read More</a>&raquo;</p>
